# Life_Easier

A Telegram bot built in Golang to help people remember to do their useful things

#### You can try it [here](https://t.me/Life_Easier_bot)

### How it works:
If you find something interesting on the internet or want to do something in the future, simply send the link or a message to the bot. It will store your request and send you the link or reminder at a later time, when you need it most.
